          <p>My name is Kasia and I am the author of this blog. So glad that you have joined my community of readers! The more the merrier-what some like to say. However, for me the most important thing is to gather in here people with the same interests and hobbies and create a safe yet bold space for the expression of our thoughts and ideas.
            As you have probably noticed, I am very interested into fashion, fashion design, fashion magazines and basically everything that is related to fashion. My dream future career is to work withing the fashion industry but with the focus on publishing of the fashion magazines. I think that I don’t have to add that my biggest dream is Vogue…
            </p>
          <p>My story started when I was about 11 years old and decided to start creating and designing my own magazines from the scratches of the ones that I’ve already bought. I loved it. Cutting photos, adding glitter, making collages-all of that was a big driving factor for me. When I was 14 I started to writing some stories and ‘books’. All of that was followed by me sewing some clothes for my dolls and having the time of my life by just being creative with it. </p>
