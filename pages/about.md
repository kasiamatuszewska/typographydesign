Hey! 

My name is Kasia and I have just started my journey with blogging. I am very interested into fashion-realted content and hope to work within the fashion industry in the future. That's why the content on this blog is highly realted to luxurious fashion brands, magazines and fashion shows. 

This website is for all of the poeple who enjoy a little fashion knowledge connected with some design theory and facts. As our community is growing very quickly I would love **YOU** to become a part of it as well. Get involved into commenting on the new posts, share them on your social media or text me directly using one of the links to my social media.  

As the luxuriousness itself is very often connected with monochromatics colors, no decorative fonts or colorful pictures, I wanted to create a blog that even though talks about all of those topics, it still does not feel so 'official' . It is a safe space with a lot of positive energy that explains the outgoing typographic trends within the fashion area and you can also get engaged.

All of the high-fashion-realted topics are being explored. Starting from logos of the luxurious brands and ending on controversial fashion shows. There is no space for tabu. 

Together we can build an amazing community of people. Enjoy your stay here and hopefully you are gonna stick with me for a longer time!
